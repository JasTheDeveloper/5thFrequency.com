                Venus is the second planet from the Sun, located between Mercury and Earth. The planet is often called Earth's "sister planet" because of its similar size and mass. It is slightly smaller than Earth. Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system. The extreme heat is due to its thick atmosphere, which creates a runaway greenhouse effect. The atmospheric pressure on Venus is about 92 times greater than on Earth, equivalent to being 900 meters underwater on Earth. Venus has a unique rotation. It spins the opposite direction to most planets. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east on Venus. Its rotation is very slow: One day on Venus takes 243 Earth days. Unlike Earth, but similar to Mercury, Venus has no moons or rings. The high temperatures, crushing atmospheric pressure, and toxic atmosphere makes Venus an inhospitable place for human life or robotic exploration. Many spacecraft sent to Venus in the past were destroyed by its harsh conditions within hours.
