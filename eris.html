                Eris is a dwarf planet located in the outer reaches of our solar system.  It is best known for being one of the objects that led to redefinition of what constitues a planet, ultimately causing <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a> to be reclassified as a dward planet.  Eris is one of the largest known dwarf planets.  It is slightly smaller than Pluto but more massive.  It has about 27% more mass than Pluto, making it one of the most massive known dwarf planets in the solar system.  Like Pluto, Eris is primarily composed of rock and ice.  Its surface is believed to be covered with a layer of frozen methane, which gives it a bright, reflective appearance.  The exact details of its internal structure remain unknown, but it likely has a rocky core beneath its icy exterior.  Eris has a high reflectivity, meaning it reflects a significant amount of sunlight, which is why it appears so bright.  This reflectivity is due to its surface being covered with methane ice.  It has a more reflective surface than Pluto, making it one of the brightest objects in the solar system.  Eris does not have a permanent atmosphere.  However, it's believed that when Eris comes closer to the Sun during its orbit, some of the methane ice on its surface may turn directly from solid to gas, forming a temporary atmosphere.  When it moves farther from the Sun, the atmosphere would freeze back onto the surface.  Eris has a highly elliptical orbit that takes it far beyond Pluto, in a region of the solar system called scattered disk, part of the Kuiper Belt.  Its orbit is more inclined than that of most planets, meaning it travels at a steep angle relative to the plane of the solar system.  Eris is an extremely distant object, with its orbit taking it as far as 97 Astronomial Units (AU) from the Sun at its farthest point.  A day on Eris is about 25.9 hours, meaning its day is similar in lenth to an Earth day.  Eris has one known moon named Dysnomia, after the Greek goddess of lawlessness and daughter of Eris.  Eris is named after the Greek goddess of strife and discord, reflecting the controversy and debate it caused in the astronomical community about what defines a planet.  The moon Dysnomia, named after Eris's daughter, further emphasizes the theme of disorder and lawlessness.
