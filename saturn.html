                Saturn is the second-largest planet after <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>.  Despite its size, it is less dense than water, meaning if there were a body of water large enough, Saturn would float.  Saturn is a gas giant, primarily made up of hydrogen (about 96%) and helium (about 3%), with traces of methane, ammonia, and other compounds.  Like <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter,</a> Saturn does not have a solid surface; its outer layers are thick clouds of gas.  Saturn is most famous for its stunning ring sytem, which is made of billions of particles, ranging in size from tiny grains to objects as large as as houses.  These rings are composed of mainly of ice, with traces of rock and dust.  The rings span over 170,000 in diameter but are incredibly thin, only about 30 feet thick in some places.  The planet experiences strong winds winds, reaching up to 1,100 miles per hour near the equator.  Saturn has extreme weather, including massive storms The most notable is the "Great White Spot," a periodic storm that appears in Saturn's atmosphere about every 30 years.  Saturn has a strong magnetic field, though weaker than Jupiter's.  This magnetic field interacts with the solar wind and contributes to the creation of auroras at Saturn's poles.  Saturn rotates very quickly, completing a full rotation in about 10.7 hours.  This fast rotation causes the planet to bulge at the equator, making it noticeably flattened.  It takes Saturn about 29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit around the <a href="sun.html">Sun.</a>  Saturn has 145 known moons, with Titan being the largest and most well knwon.

                Emotionally, Saturn is about endurance and resilience.  It represents the capacity to endure hardship, remain steadfast, and come out stronger after overcoming challenges.  Saturn encourages emotional maturity, teaching individuals to face difficulties with a steady, composed mindset.  Saturn's energy also highlights the need for healthy emotional boundaries.  It helps individuals establish limits in relationships, knowing when to say "no", and protecting themseles from emotional overwhelm or dependency.  This can lead to emotional stability but may also result in emotional distance or detachment if taken to extremes.  Saturn can be linked to a tendency to control or suppress emotions, sometimes leading to emotional rigidity.  There is a focus on managing one's emotional responses in a practical, controlled manner, often prioritizing reason over feeling.  This can create a sense of emotional responsibility but may also lead to emotional repression if one is not careful.  Saturn can sometimes bring feelings of loneliness, isolation,  or a sense of being burdened by responsibilies.  However, it also teaches individuals to be emotionally self-sufficient, developing inner strength and learning to rely on themselves in challenging times.
