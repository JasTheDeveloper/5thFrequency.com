                Pluto is a relatively small planet planet.  It is smaller than Earth's <a href="moon.html">Moon.</a>  Pluto is primarily composed of rock and ice.  Its surface is a mix of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices.  Beneath the surface, scientists believe there may be a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water.  Pluto has a highly varied surface, with regions of bright and dark terrain.  Its most famous surface feature is the "heart-shaped" Tombaugh Regio, named after Pluto's discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh.  Pluto has a thin atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.  Its atmosphere expands when Pluto is closer to the Sun, warming and sublimating some of its surface ice into gas, and contracts as it moves away from the Sun, causing the gases to freeze back onto the surface.  Pluto's orbit around the Sun is highly elliptical, meaning it sometimes comes closer to the Sun than Neptune.  However, it is usually farther away, with an average distance of about 3.7 billion miles.  It takes 248 Earth years for Pluto to complete one orbit around the Sun.  Pluto has an axial tilt of 120 degrees, causing it to rotate on its side like Uranus.  Its rotation is also retrograde, meaning it spins in the opposite direction to most planets in the solar system.  A day on Pluto (one rotation) lasts about 6.4 Earth days.  Pluto is extremely cold, with surface temperatures ranging from -375 to -400 degrees fahrenheit.  These frigid conditions are due to its great distance from the Sun.  Pluto was reclassified as a "dward planet" in 2006 because it does not meet all three criteria for full planet status.  It orbits the Sun and is massive enough to be spherical, but it hasn't cleared its orbit of other debris.  This led to its reclassification along with other dwarf planets like <a href="eris.html">Eris</a> and Haumea.  Pluto was named after the Roman god of the underworld, fitting for such a distant and mysterious world.  The name was suggested by an 11-year-old girl from England, Venetia Burney, in 1930.

                In astrology and symbolic interpretations, Pluto is a planet of transformation, power, death, and rebirth.  It represents the deep, often hidden forces that drive significant change and renewal in our lives.  Its energy is intense, often associated with destruction and regeneration, leading to profound psychological and spiritual growth.  Psychologically, Pluto governs processes of transformation, both internally and externally.  It symbolizes the death of old ways of thinking or being and the subsequent rebirth of a more evolved self.  Pluto represents the psychological drive to confront and overcome obstacles, helping individuals emerge stronger and more self-aware after periods of personal crisis or deep inner change.  Pluto is deeply connected to the unconscious mind and the shadow self (parts of ourselves that we may repress, deny, or ignore.)  Psychologically, Pluto pushes individuals to confront their deepest fears, desires, and unresolved issues.  This often involves exploring the darker, hidden aspects of the psyche in order to heal and integrate them, leading to profound psychological growth.  Pluto's energy is associated with power, control, and dominance.  Psychologically, it can represent a desire for control over oneself and others, or the fear of losing control.  This can manifest as a power struggle, either within oneself or in relationships, as individuals confront issues related to authority, dominance, and submission.  The key lesson of Pluto is learning to harness personal power in healthy, constructive ways.  Pluto brings an intense, all-or-nothin approach.  individuals influed by Pluto tend to exerience emotions and thoughts at a deep, transformative level, with little tolerance for superficiality.  This psychological intensity often leads to a deep interest in the mysteries of life, psychology, and the underlying forces that shape human behavior.  Pluto is linked to crises that force individuals to face difficult truths.  These moments of catharsis are essential for personal transformation, as Pluto compels individuals to break down old patterns in order to rebuild on a stronger foundation.  Though painful, these psychological crises lead to deeper insight, self-awarness, and renewal.

Pluto is associated with the underworld, both literally and symbolically.  spiritually, it governs the exploration of hidden knowledge, mysteries, and the occult.

Pluto is associated with spiritual purification, a process in which individuals shed their lower, ego-driven sleves to connect with their higher selves.  This purification is often intense and involves confronting unresolved karmic issues, traumas, or negative patterns.  Once these elements are faced and transformed, Pluto provides a sense of spiritual renewal and rebirth.
